# Project description

This project uses machine learning models to perform prediction and inference tasks. The structure of the project is as follows:

## How to use

- **Main model learning**: Run the `sc_ml_20.ipynb` file to learn the main model.
- **On-device model learning**: Run the `sc_ml_30.ipynb` file to learn the on-device model.
- **Prediction**: Run the `prediction.ipynb` file to perform the prediction task.
- **Webcam inference**: Execute the `inference_web_cam.ipynb` file to perform inference using the webcam.

Each notebook file contains detailed instructions along with the required code.

## Requirements

Before running the project, the required libraries and dependencies must be installed. Information about required libraries is listed at the top of each notebook file.
